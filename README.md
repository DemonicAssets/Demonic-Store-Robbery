Demonic Store Robbery turns every 24/7, liquor store, and corner shop in your city into a proper high-risk heist, not just a “press E for cash” script.

Built for QBX/QBCore, it plugs straight into your existing setup, using ox_inventory for rewards and ps-dispatch for clean police alerts.

What it does

Every configured store becomes robbable with its own settings
– custom rewards, cooldowns, and police requirements.

Robberies are multi-stage
– hit the registers, crack the safe/backroom, then get out before cops show up.

Skill-based gameplay
– hooks are ready so you can plug in your own minigames (lockpicking, hacking, codes, etc.).

Police integration via ps-dispatch
– proper alerts, blips and labels, plus configurable minimum on-duty officers before a robbery can start.

Balanced economy with ox_inventory
– payouts are fully configurable: cash, marked bills, items, or custom loot tables, per store.

Anti-abuse friendly
– server-side checks, cooldowns, distance/radius validation and one active robbery per store at a time.

Optimized for live servers
– idle 0.00ms usage and only runs logic when players are actually doing something.

If you’re running a serious RP server on Qbox/QBCore with ox_inventory and ps-dispatch, Demonic Store Robbery gives your criminals something real to plan around and your cops something real to respond to.
